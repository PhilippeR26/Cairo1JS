# Cairo1JS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Stars are appreciated!

## Presentation

This small project demonstrates how to create a DAPP to interact with the Starknet blockchain.  
You can interact easily with Cairo 1 smart-contract, using your Argent-X or Braavos wallets (installed in your desktop or mobile browser).  
The communication with the wallet can be made only with Wallets compatible with the new Wallet API.

Analyze the code to see how to create a such DAPP (start [here](https://github.com/PhilippeR26/Cairo1JS/blob/starknet-react/src/app/(site)/page.tsx))  

The DAPP is made in the next.js framework. Coded in Typescript. Using React, Zustand context & Chaka-ui components.

> [!NOTE]
> This branch is coded with a higher level library: starknet-react, that replaces starknet.js+get-starknet.

## Getting Started 🚀
