# Cairo1JS

## Presentation

This small project demonstrates how to create a DAPP to interact with the Starknet blockchain.  
You can interact easily with Cairo 1 smart-contract, using your Argent-X or Braavos wallets (installed in your browser).  

Analyze the code to see how to create a such DAPP (start [here](src/app/page.tsx))  

The DAPP is made in the next.js framework, using the experimental **appDir** feature. Coded in Typescript. Using React, Zustand context & Chaka-ui components.

As the get-starknet.js library isn't today compatible with starknet.js V5, a temporary solution is implemented in this project, with the get-wallet-starknet.js library. To use only for development purpose.
